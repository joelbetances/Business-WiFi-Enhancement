# Network Infrastructure Assessment Guide

This guide will walk you through the steps to assess the current network infrastructure within your organization.

## Prerequisites

- Access to network hardware and software inventory
- Tools for measuring WiFi signal strength and network performance

## Steps

1. **Conduct a Site Survey**:
    - Use tools such as WiFi analyzers to measure signal strength throughout the office.
    - Identify areas with weak or no WiFi coverage (dead zones).

2. **Evaluate Current Network Performance**:
    - Measure current internet speed and bandwidth usage.
    - Identify any bottlenecks or performance issues in the network.

3. **Review Network Hardware**:
    - Check the condition and capabilities of existing network hardware (routers, switches, access points).
    - Identify any outdated or underperforming equipment that may need upgrading.

4. **Analyze Network Usage**:
    - Monitor network traffic to understand usage patterns and peak times.
    - Identify any devices or applications that are consuming excessive bandwidth.

5. **Develop an Upgrade Plan**:
    - Based on the assessment, develop a plan to address identified issues and enhance network performance.
    - Prioritize upgrades based on their impact on overall network performance.
